Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard (Personal Project)
Pizza Sales Analysis – SQL & Excel Portfolio Project
Project Overview
This project is an end to end data analytics case study based on pizza sales data for the year 2015. It replicates a real client scenario where a business wants to validate dashboard numbers using SQL and visualize key metrics in an interactive Excel dashboard. The workflow covers requirement gathering, data loading into MS SQL Server, data cleaning, SQL analysis, and dashboard design in Excel

Business Problem & Objectives

•	A set of high level KPIs to summarize business performance.
•	Validation of all KPI numbers using SQL queries against a database table.
•	An interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes trends and best/worst selling pizzas
